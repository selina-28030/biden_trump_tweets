# Is polarization in US politics reflected in the 2020 presidential candidates' tweets?

Using this dataset of Joe Biden's [tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao/joe-biden-tweets), I took a deeper dive into Joe Biden's tweets, looking at most and least popular topics and performance metrics. The second section compares the most common words from the visualization of word vectors for their tweets and the polarity of Biden versus Trump's [tweets](https://www.thetrumparchive.com) from the past two years. 

Despite some desire expressed for more substantive policy discussion or weariness about the incessant Trump coverage, the most popular topics were **Donald Trump,  Covid-19, and Kamala Harris** and the least popular were **agriculture and trade policy, national security, and rural communities**. 

The difference in rhetoric is stark on topics such as healthcare, race, and immigration with Biden's language often reflecting an **appeal to ethics** with words such as "moral," "equality," "rights," and "respect" while Trump's language reflects an attempt to **politicize the pandemic and racial grievances** at the state and local level (i.e. "california," "mayor," "disaster" and "fraud"). 

Biden's has steadily tweeted more and more often over the **past two years**, but audience engagement has only begun significantly increasing **beginning March 2020**. 

Biden's tweets tend to be more **strongly positive or negative** and Trump's tweets contain far **greater range and variation** in polarity. 


## Biden's Most Popular Topics

From ranking his 2019-2020 tweets by number of likes, these are the common themes among the top 20:

### Donald Trump

Out of his top 20 most liked tweets, 7 directly mentioned Donald Trump and 6 are in response to either his words or actions ("You won't have to worry about my tweets when I'm president"). 

As many pundits have noted, the 2020 election was framed as a referendum on the Trump presidency. Biden's most liked tweets were a reflection of that, with his blunt criticism
>Donald Trump is the worst president we've ever had. 

being his most popular tweet, with 1,890,946 likes. 

#### Covid-19 and Donald Trump

His other most popular tweets often responded to developments relating to Trump and Covid-19, Trump asking about injecting [disinfectants](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52407177) and contracting Covid, by combining an admonishment of him and his rhetoric while encouraging readers to continue taking safety precautions.
> I can’t believe I have to say this, but please don’t drink bleach.


> Wear a mask. Wash your hands. Vote out Donald Trump.

One notable shift was his expression of concern and care responding to news of the Trumps contracting Covid and releasing his Covid negative results, as he continued to emphasize safety precautions.

>Jill and I send our thoughts to President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump for a swift recovery. We will continue to pray for the health and safety of the president and his family.


> I’m happy to report that Jill and I have tested negative for COVID. Thank you to everyone for your messages of concern. I hope this serves as a reminder: wear a mask, keep social distance, and wash your hands.

### Kamala Harris

President-Elect Biden's selection process for VP generated intense speculation, with names such as Karen Bass, Elizabeth Warren, Tammy Duckworth, Gretchen Whitmer, and many others circulating in news coverage around the topic. It comes as no surprise that tweets such as these

>I have the great honor to announce that I’ve picked @KamalaHarris — a fearless fighter for the little guy, and one of the country’s finest public servants — as my running mate.

 >@KamalaHarris, you made us all proud tonight.

have over 830k and 1 million likes, respectively. The VP debate was hotly anticipated by opponents of Trump who expected Senator Harris to strongly rebuke the Trump administration's handling of the pandemic in a fiery debate. 

## Biden's Least Popular Topics

Though topics range from increasing broadband access in rural America to foreign policy, perhaps the underlying thread is that more substantive policy positions and announcements do not garner the same amount of engagement as what is already considered newsworthy. 

### Rural America, Agriculture, and Trade
Despite the importance of the Midwest with several battleground states and the outsized role of Iowa during the primary (where agriculture and trade policy are key), Biden's tweets pertaining to these topics averaged around 60-80 likes. 

>  Detroit — and our country as a whole — is like its people: resilient and tough. Defined by a work ethic that is unmatched by any place in the world. And when given half a fighting chance, there’s nothing the American people can’t do.

>@GovernorBullock Thanks for the recommendation, @GovernorBullock! I’d love to try it next time I’m in Decorah.

>We will pursue a trade policy that works for American farmers, transform our agriculture sector, triple funding for rural broadband, and bring cutting-edge manufacturing jobs to rural America.

>A Biden administration will help rural communities fully access federal resources and tackle persistent poverty in rural America.

Post-election, it is interesting to note that Detroit was crucial in carrying Biden to victory in [Michigan](https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/11/06/joe-biden-detroit-michigan-vote-election-2020/6168971002/), but in Montana where Bullock is currently the Democratic governor, Trump won 56.92% of the vote and Bullock was defeated by the incumbent Steve Daines in the Senate race. 

And according to [exit polls](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/exit-polls-president.html), Trump also held a significant majority of support from rural voters (57%). 

### Gun Control

>We don't need to convince the American public that common-sense measures to reduce gun violence are a good idea. 2 in 3 people believe that we need stricter gun laws.

> We need action. But the NRA and gun manufacturers have such a firm grip on Republicans in Congress that they refuse to consider common-sense gun reforms.

The 1994 Crime Bill Biden was instrumental in passing is controversial for its role in increasing mass incarceration, but it also included a ban on assault weapons that Republicans attempt to strip. Despite widespread support for gun reform, the issue was not a top priority for voters who unsurprisingly were more concerned about the economy, racial inequality, and the pandemic.

### National Security and Foreign Policy
Tweets pertaining to this topic go back to 2012, during Biden's tenure as President Obama's VP. 

>Recap the VP's 2009 trip to Chile and Costa Rica and read the op-ed he wrote for Latin American newspapers: http://t.co/i6sCWmsa

>On Thursday, VP Biden will make a campaign stop at NYU to talk about national security.

>In May 2010, the VP reaffirmed U.S. solidarity with a unified EU in an address to the European Parliament: http://t.co/QhKwAL21

Although Biden did play an important role in shaping foreign policy under the Obama administration, foreign policy has consistently been a topic that has generated bipartisan consensus and has not been a priority for the majority of the American people (which is not good for social media engagement). 

Interestingly, likes for these tweets average at around 3, but retweets are much higher, ranging anywhere from 10-40. If I were to speculate, many of them are probably attributed to DC think tanks and foreign policy analysts. 

## Biden's Twitter Metrics, Visualized
### Number of tweets from 2019-2020

As AOC mentioned "[if you’re not on the internet, if your main points of reliance are TV and mail, then you’re not running a campaign on all cylinders](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/07/us/politics/aoc-biden-progressives.html)." This seems to be something the Biden campaign seemed to be aware of as they quickly increased their social media presence. There's also a spike in the number of tweets right as Covid-19 became a full-blown crisis in the US, but also a decrease in the following weeks.

If you're curious about that one spike in April 2019, the tweet was in reply to a derogatory video Donald Trump posted about Joe Biden. The tweet was sent April 4, 2019 and Biden announced his presidential campaign April 25, 2019. 
> I see that you are on the job and presidential, as always.

Biden's has steadily tweeted more and more often over the **past two years**, but audience engagement has only begun significantly increasing **beginning March 2020**. 

## Most Common Words (Trump vs Biden)

Visualizing t-SNE representations of the most common words from high-dimenensional word vectors (word2vec):

### Biden

### Trump
![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/to2qYbG.png)

### Breakdown by Topic:
#### Covid-19/Healthcare
Biden: health, care, affordable, access, workers, act, public

Biden: pandemic, threat, failed, power, lead, history, office, character

Trump: health, care, lower, drug, prices, business, future

Trump: covid19, california, city, relief, free, israel, freedom

#### The Economy
Biden: economic, economy, women, global, rights, front, families, lines, against, lives

Trump: jobs, economic, numbers, lowest, unemployment, rate, stock, market, record, number, highest, billion, dollars

#### Immigration
Biden: immigrants, moral, bill, policies, true, words

Trump: wall, border, southern, security, crime

Trump: immigration, drugs, high, government, through

#### Race and Policing

Biden: race, equality, planet, service, division, paying, voting, month

Biden: black, create, provide, respect, good, equal, lost, 100, other, fighting, union, young, small, loved

Trump: race, based, on, disaster, political, fraud, mayor, public

Trump: destroy, police, away, wants

The difference in rhetoric is stark on topics such as healthcare, race, and immigration with Biden's language often reflecting an **appeal to ethics** with words such as "moral," "equality," "rights," and "respect" while Trump's language reflects an attempt to **politicize the pandemic and racial grievances** at the state and local level (i.e. "california," "mayor," "disaster" and "fraud"). 

One caveat to this is that Biden's appeal to ethics is framed as hopeful and positive on topics such as race and immigration, but this is contrasted by his condemnation of Trump's handling of the pandemic where he invokes the power and responsibility of the office he holds to criticize Trump. 

Although the close proximity between "israel" and "coronavirus" may be baffling as Trump rarely refers to both topics in the same tweet, it may be a reflection of the way he speaks about both, emphasizing the importance of freedom. 

## Polarity of Biden vs Trump Tweets

Polarity is a measure of the opinion expressed in a text from -1 to 1,  negative to positive, respectively. 

Using nltk, I ran a sentiment intensity analyzer on each tweet to create a new variable, polarity score. 

### Polarity by Hour

#### Biden:
![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/w4VhSKp.png)
#### Trump:
![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/s654LYE.png)

These hours are in GMT, which is five hours ahead of EST. I was worried for a second that my assumption that Trump tweeted at later hours of the night was fictitious, but the data shows that Trump tweets into later hours of the night.

For both men, many negatively polar tweets are published later in the night: for Biden, around midnight and for Trump, 3 and 4am. However, Trump tends to start tweeting earlier and those earlier tweets also contain the majority of his negative tweets (and positive tweets). 

Trump's positive tweets contain a wide range of variation, but hover around 0.25 and 0.75, while Biden's are more strongly positive, with tweets hovering around 0.75 to 1. 

### Polarity by Year 

Given the polarized state of the country, I was wondering if this would be reflected in the tweets released this year. 

#### Biden:

#### Trump:
![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/8rodxea.png)


Continuing on the analysis of Trump's range of polarity, most of his tweets are classified as positive. There's almost a straight line of darker red dots that can be drawn between 0.25 and 0.50 and 0.50 and 0.75. 

Both Biden and Trump, increased their output of tweets nearing the election date shown by the darkening blue and red dots on the right side. 

Biden's tweets are also mostly classified as positive, but a greater amount of his negative tweets tend be classified as strongly negative, with darker blue dots populating the area from -0.5 to -1. However, the trend from more strongly positive tweets from Biden in the hourly analysis holds here, especially nearing Election Day, with the strong cluster of dark blue at the top right corner.
